# Profilio2-2

## Description

Profilio2-2 is meant to be a version of Profilio2 that is actually capable of doing what it claimes.  Proilio2 was primarily part of a class project, but as such it was not important that it actually be functional to achieve a good grade.  As I mentioned in the Profilio2 README, What was lacking in its functionality was the ability of the site to actually send a email from the "Contact" section.  For the course, it was merely important to have the various sections with particular boxes checked.  One of them that there be a form in "Contacts," but It didn't need to actually function (i.e. send an email when "submit" was clicked).  The purpose of Profilio2-2 is to work on the site again without worrying about messing up the origional code of Profilio2.  When complete Profilio2-2 will allow for the site to send me an email to my actual email address (as I intend to eventually use this site as my personal website).  


## Installation
This page has not been deployed.  I'm currently not sure where I will put the releavnt files, yet either. I'm going to aim to have the site work if the files are loaded into a local folder.  There using a Node terminal, one should be able to type npm install to install all the necessary node dependencies.  Then, I believe I will plan to allow for a "npm run start" command to both start the server (which will now be required) as well as start up the local client in the user's default browser.
